# Contributing to MongoMan

We love your input! We want to make contributing to MongoMan as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
